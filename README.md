# mandelrust
Renderer for the mandelbrot set, implemented in the rust programming language.

Since I am writing this program in order to learn rust, there will be some messy code in this repository.

Implemented features:
- rendering to a window
- commandline interface

Planned features:
- multithreading
- rendering to images
